# handwrittenweb

This project is about recognizing handwritten numbers using TensorflowJS and opencvJS. Since I am a big fan of TensorflowJS I created it exclusively in Javascript.

Included is a very well trained ConVNet, trained with TensorflowJS under NodeJS. Unfortunately, it currently only recognizes the numbers: 0,2,3,4,5,6,8 - since I haven't found good training data for the other numbers yet - at least not in Germany....
